    title: 'Ideas arrive here at WTM London Virtual!',
    body: `As we continue to adapt to COVID-19 and social distancing, virtual 
      events are rising as a replacement for our missing one-to-one live interactions.
      After 40 years of hosting especially in-person travel shows, WTM London 2020 is 
      facilitating a completely virtual event that is taking place from 9 to 11 November. 
      The main aim is to help recover and rebuild the travel industry at the time when 
      it needs it above all.
      The virtual trade show will take place across three days, from 7am-10pm, to
      allow access from the different zones across the globe.    
      WTM London’s Senior Director Simon Press said: “This will be 
      a vital opportunity for senior buyers to reconnect with valuable
      contacts in the wake of the pandemic, as we all look to recover 
      and rebuild in 2021. Many travel businesses have seen widespread
      changes in personnel over the course of the COVID-19 crisis so 
      it’s more important than ever for buyers and suppliers to make 
      contact with the right people in order to plan their roadmap to recovery”.
